        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack developer with many years of programming experience 💻
        </p> 

        <p>
          In particular, I make use of technologies such as C# and Java to create modern, high-performance applications although between the two I prefer C# 😋
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, I am an AGILE Scrum enthusiast, I have recently finished a course and soon I plan to take the SCRUM Master certification 🥳
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I am also an avid music and MotoGp fan, and when I am not working, I indulge in my passion for tennis and enjoy doing a lot of outdoor walking 🚶‍♂️
